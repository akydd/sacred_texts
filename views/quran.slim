        h1 Quran API

      p This site uses an English tranlsation of the Quran by Ahmed Ali, which was
        obtained from <a href="http://tanzil.net">Tanzil.net</a>.

      p The text of the Quran is divided into Suwar (singular Sura) and Ayat
        (singular Aya). A Sura can be considered as a chapter, which contains
        multiple Ayat.  An Aya is roughtly a phrase or a sentence.

      P Each Sura has a name, but the convention seems to be to use the number of
        the Sura, and not the name.
        For example:
        <pre>
        7:151
        </pre>
        refers to the 151st Aya of the 7th Sura.
