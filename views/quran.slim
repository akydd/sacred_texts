    p This site uses an English tranlsation of the Quran by Ahmed Ali, which was
      obtained from <a href="http://tanzil.net">Tanzil.net</a>.

    p The text of the Quran is divided into Suwar (singular Sura) and Ayat
      (singular Aya). A Sura can be considered as a chapter, which contains
      multiple Ayat.  An Aya is roughtly a phrase or a sentence.

    P Each Sura has a name, but the convention seems to be to use the number of
      the Sura, and not the name.
      <pre>
      {
        "name": "Quran passage",
        "properties": {
          "sura": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Chapter",
            "required": true
          },
          "aya": {
            "type": "number",
            "description: "sentence",
            "required": true
          },
            "text": {
            "type": "string",
            "description: "passage text",
            "required": true
          }
        }
      }
      </pre>
      For example:
      <pre>
      {
        "sura": 1,
        "aya": 1,
        "text" : "In the name of Allah , the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful."
      }
      </pre>
